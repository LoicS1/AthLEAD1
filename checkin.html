          <p>AthLEAD's check-in app, when installed on an iPAD, includes an easy to use, practical user
          interface to allow for quick transactions, along with backend software to
          pull information directly from track meet result websites to enable parsing
          given a name or event. The point of this software 
          is to combat the disorganized check in systems that are currently used at track meets,
          while connecting directly to the hip number for a smoother check-in process.

           The app combines web-scraping with Java substring logic and loops to form a 
           search engine, capable of running through raw data from track meet result 
           websites and organizing athletes into various lists based on their races. 
           Utilizing the Java library jsoup, the app is able to pull information directly
           from the html paragraph tags of the website of choice (examples: Diablo Timing,
           Adkins Trak). Once the entire string of races is pulled from the given URL and 
           stored locally in the Java code, the program then goes about dividing the string up
           by events, then the events into heats, then the heats into athletes. Finally, 
           the code adds each athlete to an initialized global arraylist, which it can then 
           search through by athlete name.
          </p>
      
         
         <p>
           Each athlete is stored as an "Athlete" class, which allows us to store 
           different variables for each person including their name, grade, school,
           event, heat, and most importantly, what their hip number is and whether 
           they've been checked in. Finally, the app uses the check-in iPAD's near field
           communication technology (NFC), to send the hip number value directly to our
           smart tech hip number.
