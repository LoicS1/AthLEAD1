            We received many positive comments:
          </p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">I love the idea, pieces of stickers have gotten stuck to my shorts so
          now there's old sticker on it that won't come off. This would make 
          everything easier and it would look really cool. Great thinking
          </p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">
          It sounds really convenient and nice, I'd love to see this at meets.
          </p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">
            This sounds awesome!!! I think it's a great idea :)
          </p>
          <p>
           We also recieved suggestions for improvement. Currently, the main issues
           are cost and ease of wearing/use. Some of the comments were misunderstandings that stemmed from a lack
           of detailed explanation in some parts of the survey. Nonetheless, we've developed our product a lot since those
           responses (such as replacing the velcro by a metal clip), and are pleased to say
           it is now lighter and less expensive (scroll down for full
           cost analysis).
          </p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">
            love the idea! I'm a little concerned about how the velcro night stay on, as there 
            is a lot of leg movement while racing in addition to the fact that it doesn't work as
            well over time. also would the cost be affordable for all racers or would the schools 
            pay for it? I don't think that my team has the budget for that or for new uniforms that 
            would attach to the velcro.
          </p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">
            How would the weight of the product given the connection to the phone and 
            the screen size needed to be seen from the timing camera compare to a normal sticker?
            Would meets run on a shoestring budget suffer from needing to integrate with this system?
            How would a meet where the numbers are given on-the-fly (like NCFSC) deal with the check-in system?
            If an athlete's phone ran out of battery would they still have to use a normal sticker
            or would they be able to use someone else's phone to check in? (If they used someone else's phone
            how do you eliminate the possibility of that other person accidentally checking in as a different athlete)
            How would an athlete running late to the meet be stopped from checking in before they arrive?

          <p>AthLEAD is officially endorsed by Coach Williams, a prominent figure 
          in California coaching and the head cross country
          and track coach at Dublin High, who is largely responsible for the outstanding
          success both boys and girls teams have experienced.
          </p>
          <p>
         We've also reached out to multiple coaches in the Bay Area for their input.
          </p>
          <p>
        Additionally, AthLEAD is fully compatible with the timing software used by local companies
        like Diablo Timing and Adkins Trak West, enabling a streamlined process from
        check-in to posting of race results on Athletic.net.

              It would seem as if the price point for the product (each hip number 
              would be valued at around $6.50, according to our calculations given 
              the cost of currently available materials) would be too expensive, 
              given that a plastic hip sticker cost 100 times less, according to 
              vsathletics. But given that two plastic hip stickers are required every 
              race, not even counting the cost of wear on clothing, after an average
              season of 20 races, $2.40 is already saved. Each athlete with a reusable
              hip number will also save, through the app, about $1.50 in meet management
              costs per season (this figure accounts for the cost of the check-in I-pads
              that must be bought), and $0.50 in trash collection. So, after just about a
              season and a half, the system becomes profitable for coaches and meet managers.
